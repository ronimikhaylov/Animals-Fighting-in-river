# Animals-Fighting-in-river
Java Program to stimulate an ecosystem containing two types of creatures, bears and fish. The ecosystem consists of a river which is modeled as a relatively large array. Each cell of the array should contain an animal object, which can be a bear or fish object, or null. In each time step, based on a random process, each animal either attempts to move into an adjacent array cell or stay where it is. If two animals of the same type (but different gender) are about to collide into the same cell, then they stay where they are, but they create  an offspring which will be placed into a random cell and they stay where they are. If a bear and a fish collide, the fish gets eaten. If two male or  two female bears collide into one another, then they fight, and who ever has a higher strength (initialized randomly), wins the fight and strength increases by 4.
